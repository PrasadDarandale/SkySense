SkySense: Wheather Dashboard
SkySense is a smart, interactive dashboard that delivers real-time weather and air quality insights through clear visuals, helping users quickly understand atmospheric conditions and trends.

This project is an interactive weather and air quality dashboard designed to provide real-time environmental insights in a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. The dashboard presents current weather conditions, short-term forecasts, and detailed air quality metrics for better situational awareness and decision-making.

The Dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
☁️ Weather & Air Quality APIs - Data sourcing.
📂 Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals and conditional logic.
📂File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

The data used in SkySense is collected from public weather and air quality APIs, which provide real-time and forecast information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and Air Quality Index (AQI).

∙ Business Problem :
  Users lack a single, reliable platform to view real-time weather and air quality data in a clear and visual format, making timely and informed   decisions difficult.

• Goal of the Dashboard :
  The goal of the SkySense dashboard is to provide a centralized, real-time view of weather and air quality data through interactive and easy-     to- understand visualizations, enabling users to make informed, timely, and safety-focused decisions.

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals :
  Location & Current Weather: Displays the selected city with current temperature and weather condition.
  
  7-Day Forecast Chart: Shows upcoming temperature trends to help users anticipate weather changes.
  
  Sunrise & Sunset Panel: Provides daily sunrise and sunset timings.
  
  Weather Metrics Cards: Highlights humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, UV index, and precipitation.
  
  Chance of Rain Indicator: Visualizes the probability of rainfall.
  
  Air Quality Index (AQI) Panel: Presents overall air quality status with pollutant-level breakdown (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO).
