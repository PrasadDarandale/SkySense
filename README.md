# 🌤️ SkySense – Smart Weather & Air Quality Dashboard

**SkySense** is a smart, interactive weather and air quality dashboard that delivers real-time environmental insights through clear and intuitive visuals. It helps users quickly understand atmospheric conditions, trends, and air quality levels for better awareness and decision-making.

---

## Project Overview

SkySense is designed to provide a **centralized view of real-time weather and air quality data** using a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. The dashboard presents:

- Current weather conditions  
- Short-term weather forecasts  
- Detailed air quality metrics  

This enables users to make informed, timely, and safety-focused decisions.

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- ** Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform  
- ** Weather & Air Quality APIs** – Real-time and forecast data sources  
- ** Power Query** – Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning  
- ** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic  
- ** File Formats**  
  - `.pbix` – Power BI project file  
  - `.png` – Dashboard preview images  

---

## Data Source

The data used in SkySense is collected from **public weather and air quality APIs**, providing real-time and forecast information such as:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Wind speed  
- Visibility  
- Atmospheric pressure  
- UV Index  
- Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutants  

---

##  Business Problem

Users often lack a **single, reliable platform** to view real-time weather and air quality data in a clear, visual format. This fragmentation makes it difficult to make timely and informed decisions related to travel, outdoor activities, and health.

---

##  Goal of the Dashboard

The goal of the SkySense dashboard is to provide a **centralized, real-time view** of weather and air quality data through interactive and easy-to-understand visualizations, enabling better situational awareness and safer decision-making.
